###### Correlation of Genome Size and TE Length
#### Resource http://www.sthda.com/english/wiki/correlation-test-between-two-variables-in-r
####  Pearson correlation coefficients measure the linear relationship between the variables while 
####  Spearman correlation coefficients measure only monotonic relationships, relationship in which the 
#### variables tend to move in the same/opposite direction but not necessarily at a constant rate whereas 
#### the rate is constant in a linear relationship. (https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2021/03/comparison-of-pearson-and-spearman-correlation-coefficients/)
